The project can run on any online or offline Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse, Netbeans, ideone.com, etc. You should have at least elementary knowledge of Java Programming language to work on the project. Knowledge of data structures like Graph and Heap and Algorithms like Dijkstra, BFS, DFS, etc is appreciated, however, it is not essential. And lastly, some understanding of the Collection framework makes it a cakewalk journey. (If you don't know about the Collection framework it is not a problem, you can proceed without it and while working if you feel the need to know you can refer to https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/collections-in-java-2/ ).
